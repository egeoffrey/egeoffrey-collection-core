## Content

The following modules are included in this package.

For each module, if requiring a configuration file to start, its settings will be listed under *'Module configuration'*. Additionally, if the module is a service, the configuration expected to be provided by each registered sensor associated to the service is listed under *'Service configuration'*.

To configure each module included in this package, once started, click on the *'Edit Configuration'* button on the *'eGeoffrey Admin'* / *'Modules'* page of your eGeoffrey instance.
